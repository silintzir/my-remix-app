	"instructions.basic_info": "The basic information section is the fundamental segment of a resume that provides essential details about the candidate. It includes personal data such as full name, contact information (phone number, email address), and location. This section is vital as it allows employers to reach out to applicants easily and quickly. Additionally, it ensures clarity and professionalism in presenting yourself. While seemingly straightforward, accuracy in this section is crucial to avoid communication gaps. Including a LinkedIn profile or portfolio link can enhance credibility and offer employers further insights into your professional background. This concise section sets the foundation for the entire resume and creates a positive first impression.",
	"instructions.certificates": "The certificates section in a resume holds significant value as it showcases your professional development and specialized training. Including relevant certifications highlights your commitment to staying current with industry trends and acquiring additional expertise. Employers often seek candidates with specific certifications, making this section essential for proving your qualifications. Listing notable certifications can set you apart from other applicants and demonstrate your dedication to continuous learning. Ensure you include the certification's name, issuing organization, and date of completion. While tailoring this section to the job you are applying for, be selective, and focus on certifications that directly relate to the position, reinforcing your suitability and value as a candidate.",
	"instructions.cover": "A cover letter is a separate document that accompanies your resume when applying for a job. Its primary purpose is to introduce yourself to the employer, explain why you are interested in the position and the company, and highlight your qualifications, skills, and experiences that make you a strong fit for the job. It also allows you to express your enthusiasm and personality while providing context for your application.",
	"instructions.education": "The education section is vital on a resume as it serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it demonstrates your academic qualifications and expertise in specific subjects, which is particularly important for entry-level positions. Secondly, it showcases your commitment to continuous learning and professional development, which can be appealing to employers seeking candidates who value growth. Additionally, educational achievements can set you apart from other applicants and provide context to your work experiences. For those changing careers, relevant coursework or certifications can demonstrate suitability for the new field. Furthermore, optimizing the section with relevant keywords can increase the chances of getting past applicant tracking systems.",
	"instructions.experience": "The experience section is a crucial component of a resume as it highlights your work history, showcasing your practical skills, accomplishments, and career progression. It offers potential employers insight into your relevant professional background and the value you bring to the table. This section enables you to demonstrate how your previous roles have prepared you for the position you are applying for. By listing your achievements and responsibilities in each job, you can substantiate your abilities and contributions. The experience section is particularly significant for mid to senior-level professionals, where work history carries more weight than education, but its importance can vary depending on the role and the individual's career trajectory.",
	"instructions.interests": "The interests section, though optional, can add a personal touch to your resume and provide potential employers with insights into your personality and outside passions. Including hobbies, sports, and volunteer activities can showcase well-roundedness and diverse skills. It also opens opportunities for common ground during interviews, fostering rapport with interviewers. Be mindful to mention interests that align with the job or demonstrate qualities valuable to the position. For example, team sports can reflect collaboration skills, while artistic pursuits might indicate creativity. While brief, this section can create a memorable impression, making you stand out as a unique and engaging candidate.",
	"instructions.skills": "The skills section is a pivotal component of a resume, showcasing your core competencies, technical abilities, and soft skills. It provides employers with a quick overview of your strengths and suitability for the job. Tailoring the skills listed to match the job requirements can enhance your chances of standing out. Including a mix of hard skills (e.g., programming languages, software proficiency) and soft skills (e.g., communication, teamwork) presents a well-rounded profile. Quantifying or providing specific examples of how you have applied these skills can reinforce your credibility. A well-crafted skills section complements your work experience and emphasizes your unique value to potential employers.",
	"instructions.summary": "The summary section, although not always included in modern resumes, can be valuable for fresh graduates or career changers. It concisely states your career goals and aspirations, clarifying your intention and direction. An effectively crafted objective can help employers understand your motivation and how your skills align with their needs. Tailoring the objective to each job application is essential to demonstrate your interest and commitment to the specific role and company. However, if your experience and career path are well-established, consider replacing the objective section with a professional summary that highlights your accomplishments and strengths, focusing on the value you bring to the organization.",
